Note: This proposal was funded by Wellcome Trust as part of the co-funded EOSS Cycle 6.  \n  **Leads:** Michael Love (University of North Carolina Chapel Hill) and Stefano Mangiola (University of Adelaide).  \n  **Collaborators:** Dozens of collaborating developers listed on tidyomics GitHub.  \n  **Project links:** [https://github.com/tidyomics](https://github.com/tidyomics)  \n\n\nMore details on the projects will be shared in future posts. Stay tuned!",
