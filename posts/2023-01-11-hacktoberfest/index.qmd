## What is Hacktoberfest?

In October (of the last year) Bioconductor participated in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
Hacktoberfest is a worldwide celebration of open-source projects thatâ€™s held during the month of October.
To take part people had to register at https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/ before Oct 31,
have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between Oct 1 and Oct 31.
The 1st 40,000 participants (maintainers & contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest could choose either a tree planted in their name or a t-shirt.

## Why did Bioconductor join?

As in [the Bioconductor Code of Conduct](https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual/en-US.html),
The Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes

- sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise
- collaboration
- diversity and inclusivity
- a kind and welcoming environment
- community contributions

Since the Hacktoberfest fits this CoC, we decided to join it.

## What did Bioconductor do for Hacktoberfest?
Bioconductor chose to take part to highlight some Bioconductor projects that people could contribute to. 

Community member, [Kevin Rue-Albrecht](https://github.com/kevinrue) held a meetup on [the Carpentries bioc-project](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/bioc-project).

Community member, [Kozo Nishida](https://github.com/kozo2) held a meetup on [the Bioconductor community blog](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/).

## What was the outcome & learnings?

One participant at the Carpentries bioc-project meetup, Milan Malfait [@MilanMlft](https://github.com/MilanMlft), created hacktoberfest PRs to proofread every single episode of the Carpentries bioc-project lesson and fix typos.

A participant at the blog meetup, Jeremy Selva [@JauntyJJS](https://github.com/JauntyJJS), created a great contribution for [the biocblog](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/)

Although the contributions of the above participants were excellent, but we were unable to bring people to the events.

We will advertise earlier, take suggestions for projects, in order to get people to contribute it really helps to have well-defined issues in the repositories.

## Conclusion & wrap up

We joined Hacktoberfest as an opportunity to meet community members.
Also, the participants of Hacktoberfest made great contributions.
We were not good at advertising the event, but we learned how to improve it on through Hacktoberfest.
We will continue to plan better community events in the future.
