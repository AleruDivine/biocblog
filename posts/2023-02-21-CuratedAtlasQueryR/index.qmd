## Why package was created

🧬💻🔥 We are excited to launch CuratedCellAtlasR; millions of cells are now at your fingertips. 

The harmonized and reannotated CELLxGENE singlecell human atlas can be 
explored and retrieved as SingleCellExperiment.

OR (include the twitter info below)


Step 1: Get started with #CuratedCellAtlasR by exploring the integrated metadata of 28 million cells (on-disk) using #tidyverse. The atlas includes 344 studies across 40 tissues, providing raw abundances and counts-per-million. 📊


Step 2: Filter cells of interest using #tidyverse, whether it's a specific dataset or a cell type across tissues and diseases. #CuratedAtlasQueryR makes it easy to find what you're looking for! 🔍


Step 3: Collect the #SingleCellExperiment for the cells of interest. Our object uses #HDF5 to keep the #R session light, making it easier to work with larger datasets. 💻



Step 4: With #CuratedAtlasQueryR and #tidySingleCellExperiment, checking the transcription abundance of your favourite gene and cell type across diseases, tissues and hundreds of datasets is just a few lines of code! 🎉
