## Two Years of Bioconductor Carpentry Training

As we wrap up our two years of instructor training through the CZI EOSS4 grant, we reflect on our journey since becoming a member of the Carpentries in August 2022. We started onboarding instructors for certification in January 2023, and our last instructor from the two cohorts was certified in January 2025. Since its launch, 33 trainees have participated, with  **31 successfully completing** their training. Our instructors are leading workshops, expanding Bioconductor’s reach, and strengthening the global bioinformatics community.

## Global Impact and Achievements

- **Workshops held worldwide**, including North Africa, Brazil, India, and Europe.
- **Instructor-led sessions** at major Bioconductor conferences: BioC2023, EuroBioC2023, BioCAsia2023, BioC2024, and EuroBioC2024.
- **First Bioconductor Carpentry workshop in Africa**, led by the Tunis R User Group. This event was an important step in strengthening the R and Bioconductor community in Tunisia.
- **Upcoming courses** in Kenya (March 2025), Brazil (March 2025), USA (August 2025), further expanding our regional footprint.
- **Growing engagement** with researchers and educators in underrepresented regions, helping to bridge gaps in access to bioinformatics training.

Here is an interactive map and table showcasing the global distribution of our certified instructors:

## Instructor Highlights

Our instructors are making a tangible impact:

- **Ziru Chen** became the first instructor in mainland China to be Carpentries-certified, giving her teaching demo in Mandarin, a milestone in supporting Mandarin-speaking learners.
- **Rodrigo Arcoverde Cerveira da Silva** led a workshop in Brazil, bringing bioinformatics training to researchers at the Evandro Chagas Institute in the Amazon region.
- **Leo Lahti** incorporated Bioconductor Carpentries sessions into microbiome courses in India, Norway, and Finland, expanding Bioconductor education in microbial research.

## What Instructors Say

> *"Swapping the chilly embrace of Swedish winter for the familiar heat of my hometown in the Brazilian Amazon was a long warm hug. Teaching my first workshop here was incredibly rewarding."* – Rodrigo Arcoverde Cerveira da Silva

>*"Teaching in India, Oulu, and Norway helped us integrate Bioconductor Carpentries into microbiome courses. We are now planning to expand these efforts in more regions."* – Leo Lahti

>*"Because of my experience co-teaching at BioC workshops, I finally got motivated to complete my Carpentries Instructor Certification. Now I’m looking forward to helping more Bioconductor learners!"* – Jenny Drnevich

## Participant Feedback

The impact of our training is reflected in participant feedback:

-   *"Coding alongside the course, being able to fix problems as they came up, was incredibly helpful."*
-   *"The structure of the course, the pace, and the instructors’ enthusiasm made the learning experience exceptional."*
-   *"Engaging teachers, available to help, and very useful to have the online resources if needed."*
-   *"I liked the discussion that allowed for the thought behind the process."*

## Looking Ahead

We’re excited to:

- Expand training opportunities, particularly in underrepresented regions.
- Strengthen mentorship and support for new instructors.
- Continue enhancing lesson materials and community engagement.
- Build stronger collaborations with local bioinformatics groups to increase accessibility.
