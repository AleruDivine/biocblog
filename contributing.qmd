2. Install RStudio and double click the `biocblog.Rproj` file in the cloned repo.

3. [Create a new `qmd` file](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory) in your RStudio, and check the content with clicking `Preview Website` button under the `Build` tab! ![](PreviewWebsiteButton.png)

4. When you're done, please `git commit` the raw `qmd` plus any static files you might have added to the post's source directory. Don't commit any generated files, such as html.
