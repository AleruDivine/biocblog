The [Community Advisory Board](https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/)
(established in 2020) is seeking nominations from new members.

See [this post in Bioconductor Forum](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9141753/)
from Lori Shepherd (Secretary of Community Advisory Board) for how to apply.

We were asked what the CAB looks like at
[last year's BioC2021 "Meet the CAB"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTT1i_ACpxc).

You can see the recording on YouTube above.
The Q&A transcription is on
[the CAB introduction page in bioconductor.org](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/#:~:text=EMBL%2C%20Germany.%20website-,Q%26A,-The%20following%20Q).

If you are interested in CAB and would like to know more about CAB,
you can also ask it interactively in
[our community Slack](https://bioc-community.herokuapp.com/).
(In the Slack workspace there is a channel named **community-advisory-board**.)

We look forward to receiving your nomination!
